# Balanced-Realization-in-State-Space-filter-design
A design of three IIR filters (high-pass, band-pass and band-stop) by first using a least-squared method to
design FIR filters of a specific order, cut-off frequency and group delay. Then, utilizing the balanced
truncation technique to design IIR filters with a specified reduced order and the same frequency response as
the FIR filters. This project was implemented on MATLAB.

The main script to run is the Run_Project file, this is script uses four functions that are available in the
same folder as the main script.
